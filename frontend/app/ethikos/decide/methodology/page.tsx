                  Participants see a clear question, any relevant background

                  For each stance, the engine fetches the voter&apos;s Ekoh profile in
                  the relevant domain and computes a weight within configured bounds.
                  An ethical multiplier rewards constructive behaviour, but both

                  Weighted stances are aggregated according to the chosen modality:
                  mean or median for rating, pairwise comparisons for ranking, or
                  tallying approvals for approval voting. The result is then mapped
