# Navigation Map
The list below presents every top‑level page (route) that a user can reach from the main sidebar or intent cards, grouped by module and sub‑module.
 Nested tabs, drawers or modals are noted → they do not create extra routes but keep related tasks together.
 All names preserve the K‑branding (e.g. CertifiKation, Konsensus) and nothing duplicates boiler‑plate authentication or error screens.

## Global & Cross‑Module Shell

## Kollective Intelligence

## ethiKos
Smart‑Voting education, history or “how it works” are drawers launched from buttons on the hubs — no separate routes .

## keenKonnect

## KonnectED

## Kreative (+ Kontact)

## Communication & Administration

### Top‑Level Route Count
(A modest increase vs. the earlier sketch accommodates essential Smart Vote and analytics pages without re‑introducing sprawl.)
