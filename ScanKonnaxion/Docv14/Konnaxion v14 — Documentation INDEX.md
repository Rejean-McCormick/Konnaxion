Konnaxion v14 — Documentation Index
Use this as a directory: each entry tells you which file answers a given class of question and where inside that file the relevant details live. All filenames are exactly the objects you uploaded; headings are quoted from the documents so they are easy to find with a quick full‑text search in your editor or viewer.

### 1  System‑wide references

### 2  Module technical specifications
All four layers (Frontend 5.x, Backend, DB, DevOps) are embedded in the same “Technical Specification v14” document; scroll or search for the layer heading.

### 3  Reporting & Analytics slice (layer 5)
(These four sections fully implement the “Insights” module and correspond to routes starting /reports in the Navigation Map.)

### 4  How to use this index
Need a setting or constant? Open the Parameter Reference and jump to the module number.
Need a REST endpoint, model field or pipeline? Open the Technical Specification v14 and search for the layer heading (Frontend, Backend, Database, DevOps) under the module name.
Need analytics details? Go straight to Document 5 and pick the 5.1–5.4 sub‑section.
Unsure which module owns a route or table? Check the Navigation Map (routes) or Canonical Tables list (DB).
Wondering what a code‑name like dynamic_weighted_vote is? Look it up in the Functionality Inventory.
This mapping eliminates ambiguity: every architectural or implementation question now has an authoritative source and a file/section pointer.
