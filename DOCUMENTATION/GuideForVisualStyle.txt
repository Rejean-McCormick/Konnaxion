## 1. Palette rules

1. **Primary brand color**

   * `#1e6864` is the **only accent** used in system graphics (icons, hero illustrations, badges, etc.).
2. **Neutrals for almost everything**

   * Icons, outlines, placeholders, UI pictograms: **grayscale only** except for:

     * active / selected state
     * very rare emphasis (e.g. one highlight per hero illustration)
3. **No secondary palette**

   * Do not invent additional accent colors.
   * Backgrounds and components already have their own colors from your UI; images should not fight that.

## 2. Icons (all modules)

Target: **neutral first, brand only on interaction**.

1. **Base icon (default state)**

   * Stroke: neutral gray (e.g. `#666`, `#777`).
   * Fill: none (outline icons only).
   * Background: transparent.
2. **Hover / active / selected states**

   * Only then use `#1e6864` for the stroke or small filled parts.
   * Never mix brand color with another accent inside the same icon.
3. **Special icons (badges, Smart‑Vote, etc.)**

   * Keep outer shapes neutral; use `#1e6864` only for:

     * central symbol (star/check) or
     * ring/border of the badge.

So if you’re generating icons, think:

> “Simple neutral outline icon on transparent background; when selected, recolor lines to #1e6864.”

## 3. Hero / section illustrations

1. **Color use**

   * Base: very light neutrals (off‑white, light gray).
   * Accents: **only** `#1e6864` for key shapes (graphs, key figure, or one main object).
   * Do not introduce other accent hues.
2. **Balance with UI**

   * Keep illustrations **low‑saturation** overall; they sit behind text and Ant Design components, which already inherit color from the theme.

Practical rule:

> “90–95% of pixels neutral, 5–10% in #1e6864.”

## 4. Thumbnails, covers, placeholders

1. **System‑generated covers / thumbnails** (projects, courses, debates, consultations, etc.):

   * Neutral or grayscale base imagery.
   * One subtle bar/shape in `#1e6864` (e.g. a top strip, underline, or accent corner).
2. **Placeholders (no image yet)**

   * Flat neutral panel + neutral outline icon (document, image, user).
   * Avoid using the brand color in placeholders; it should remain special for real content.

---

## 5. Avatars & profile / seed artwork

1. **Default avatars**

   * Circle with neutral background.
   * Initial or symbol in `#1e6864`.
2. **System seed artworks / profile covers**

   * If we generate them, they should mostly be neutral or soft‑tinted, with `#1e6864` as the main accent (clothing, border, or one strong shape).

User‑uploaded art, project photos, etc. are free to be any color; the **system** assets are the ones constrained by this palette.

## 6. Certificates & badges

1. **Certificates**

   * Background: white / light neutral.
   * Border and key lines: `#1e6864`.
   * No gold/silver secondary colors; use thickness/geometry (not hue) to signal importance. 
2. **Reputation / Ekoh badges**

   * Shape outline: neutral.
   * Small inner symbol or ring: `#1e6864` for “Expert” or “verified” state.
