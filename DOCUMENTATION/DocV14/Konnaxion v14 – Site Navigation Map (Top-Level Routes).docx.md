# Navigation Map 

The list below presents **every top‑level page (route)** that a user can reach from the main sidebar or intent cards, grouped by module and sub‑module.  
 Nested **tabs, drawers or modals** are noted → they do **not** create extra routes but keep related tasks together.  
 All names preserve the K‑branding (e.g. *CertifiKation*, *Konsensus*) and nothing duplicates boiler‑plate authentication or error screens.
