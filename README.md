# Konnaxion

Konnaxion is a socio-technical framework for coordinating people, knowledge, and action through a clear, ethical, and modular civic architecture.  
It follows the KOA model (KonnectED, Ethikos, Kreative, keenKonnect, EkoH, Smart Vote) and aims to connect learning, collaboration, debate, and culture, while adding domain- and ethics-aware weighting (EkoH + Smart Vote) so decisions and rankings can be read both as raw crowd signals and as expertise-sensitive views.

Konnaxion is a socio-technical framework for coordinating people, knowledge, and action through a clear, ethical, and modular civic architecture.  
Its foundations follow the KOA model (KonnectED, Ethikos, Kreative, keenKonnect, EkoH, Smart Vote), whose full functional tree is detailed in the system document.

Alongside its technical architecture, Konnaxion includes a fictional origin mythology introduced in **Konvergence** and expanded through a series of YouTube videos. This mythos presents a symbolic narrative of how a civic system can emerge in times of turbulence and transformation.

## Mythological Origins

Konnaxion’s fictional foundation appears in the **Konvergence** universe, where symbolic events, archetypes, and narrative structures illuminate the forces that shape collective intelligence.

Extended worldbuilding is presented through the following YouTube playlists and videos:

This mythology serves as an imaginative lens that complements the system’s civic functions and long-term vision.

## ️Purpose & Vision

Konnaxion advances civic coordination through:

- structured knowledge ecosystems  
- meaningful participation and constructive deliberation  
- transparent decision-making  
- merit-sensitive evaluation models  
- culturally enriched collaboration  
- shared digital spaces and cooperative workflows  

Each component is designed to operate independently or as part of a larger integrated civic ecosystem.

## Access & how to try (placeholder)

Konnaxion is in active development and is not yet exposed as a public demo instance.

This section will be updated with:

- the URL of a **public Konnaxion demo** and demo accounts;  
- how organisations can request a **pilot instance** (city, ministry, school system, NGO, etc.);  
- instructions for developers who want to **run a local stack** (services to start, commands, sample data).

Until those paths are formalised, this repository and the wiki focus on **architecture, modules, and concepts** rather than end-user onboarding.

---

## System Architecture

The Konnaxion architecture consists of six major modules, each supported by detailed functional submodules:

1. KonnectED — Learning, Knowledge, and Certification  
2. Ethikos — Structured Debate and Civic Consultation  
3. Kreative — Culture, Preservation & Professional Networks  
4. keenKonnect — Collaboration Spaces & Document Infrastructure  
5. EkoH — Merit Signaling & Contextual Evaluation  
6. Smart Vote — Flexible & Merit-Sensitive Voting  

(A full breakdown of submodules and interactions is provided in the internal KOA / Konnaxion system document and related diagrams.)

---

## 1. KonnectED — Learning, Knowledge, and Certification

### CertifiKation

- Modular certification paths  
- AI-based assessment  
- Peer validation  
- Competency portfolios  
- Interoperable credentials  

### Knowledge

- Collaborative libraries  
- Personalized recommendations  
- Co-creation tools  
- Thematic forums  
- Learning progression dashboards  

---

## 2. Ethikos — Structured Debate and Civic Consultation

### Korum

- Structured elite debates  
- AI-driven reasoning “Klônes”  
- Comparative analytics  
- Public archives  
- Automated syntheses  

### Konsultations

- Open citizen consultations  
- Proposal submission  
- Optional expertise-weighted voting (via EkoH)  
- Interactive result visualizations  
- Impact tracking  

---

## 3. Kreative — Culture, Preservation & Professional Networks

### Kreative Konservation

- Digital cultural archives  
- Virtual exhibitions  
- Comprehensive documentation  
- AI-enhanced cataloging  
- Cultural institution partnerships  

### Kontact

- Professional profiles  
- Intelligent matchmaking  
- Collaborative tools  
- Opportunity marketplaces  
- Endorsement and reputation features  

---

## 4. keenKonnect — Collaboration Spaces & Document Infrastructure

### Stockage

- Secure centralized repositories  
- Automatic versioning  
- Intelligent indexing  
- Real-time synchronization  
- Fine-grained access control  

### Konstruct

- Real-time collaborative workspaces  
- Integrated project management  
- Co-editing environments  
- Embedded messaging and video

---

## 5. EkoH — Merit Signaling & Contextual Evaluation

- Multidimensional scoring  
- Customizable criteria  
- Contextual AI interpretation  
- Adaptive confidentiality  
- Comprehensive traceability  
- Visualized merit maps  

EkoH models domain-specific and ethics-aware merit signals, which can be applied to debates, consultations, recommendations, and collaborative workspaces to generate different “readings” of activity and outcomes.

---

## 6. Smart Vote — Flexible & Merit-Sensitive Voting

- Dynamic weighting through EkoH  
- Multiple voting modalities  
- Emerging-expertise detection  
- Transparent results  
- Advanced visualizations  
- Integration across all civic modules  

Smart Vote uses EkoH-derived weights (when enabled) to produce expertise-sensitive readings alongside raw vote counts, and is designed to operate across KonnectED, Ethikos, Kreative, and keenKonnect scenarios.

---

## Technology

This repository currently includes:

- JavaScript / TypeScript services and utilities  
- Python analytical tools  
- UI concept explorations  
- Prototype service orchestration  
- Data modeling experiments  

Each component contributes to the assembly of a unified civic infrastructure. The codebase is progressively evolving from prototypes and experiments towards more stable services aligned with the architecture above.

---

## Conceptual Foundations

### Mythology & Narrative

- **Konvergence** — narrative origin of Konnaxion  
- Extended symbolic world via the Konvergence / King Klown YouTube playlists  

### Civic Architecture

- **The Book of kOA** — modular civic systems and KOA ecosystem  
- Additional philosophical and technical writings via open-access archives (PhilArchive, PhilPeople, etc.)  

Konnaxion is the principal software expression of the KOA civic architecture and the broader movement described on the public hubs (kingklown.com, kingklown.wiki, okido.wiki).

---

## ️Roadmap

Planned directions include:

- Consolidation of core primitives across modules  
- Prototype civic workflow (proposal → deliberation → decision → action)  
- Interactive interface experiments for different user roles  
- Early implementations of EkoH & Smart Vote  
- Documentation and integration pathways for external tools and institutions  
- Expanded mythology-based simulation tools and narrative UX  

Roadmap items are refined continuously based on experimentation and potential pilot needs.

---

## Contributing

Konnaxion welcomes collaborators interested in:

- coordination systems  
- collective intelligence  
- governance innovation  
- cultural knowledge infrastructures  
- AI-assisted deliberation  

Discussions, issue proposals, and architecture reviews are encouraged. As the stack stabilises, contribution guidelines and starter issues will be added.
